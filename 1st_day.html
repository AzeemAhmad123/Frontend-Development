         <span>HTML</span><span style="color: brown">(Hypertext Markup Language) </span>
         <span>is the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages.
             It provides a set of elements and tags that define the structure and
             content of a webpage.</span><span style="color: green;"> HTML </span> <span> documents consist of a series of elements, 
             each enclosed within opening and closing tags, which can contain text,
             images, links, multimedia, and other types of content.</span>

             <h2 style=" color:orchid ;">Here are some key points about HTML:</h2>

             <p style="background: yellow;">Structure: HTML provides a hierarchical structure to web content. 
                The entire HTML document is enclosed within the html tag, and it 
                consists of two main sections: <span style="color: peru;">(head)</span> and
                <span style="color: blueviolet;">(body)</span>. The head section
                contains metadata, such as the document title and links to external
                resources, while the body section holds the visible content of the webpage.</p>
           
               <h3 style="color: blue;">Key Point 2 :-</h3>
               <div>Elements and Tags: HTML elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed 
                within angle brackets (< and >). Tags can be either opening or closing tags. Opening 
                tags denote the beginning of an element, and closing tags denote the end. For example,
                the p tag is used to define a paragraph, and it is written as p.../p, with the content
                 placed between the opening and closing tags.</div>
